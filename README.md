# Sales Prediction Model - Beginner Project
This beginner-friendly, hands-on project was developed during the Flexisaf Generative AI & Data Science Program. The project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to predict sales revenue using historical sales data. 
It includes: 
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Training and evaluating two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor  
- Measuring performance using MSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score  

This project is a practical introduction to machine learning, data visualization, and business problem-solving using Python and scikit-learn.
